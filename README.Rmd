`hydroscoper` is an R interface to the  Greek National Data Bank for Hydrological and Meteorological Information, [Hydroscope](http://www.hydroscope.gr/). Hydroscope is the result of long-standing efforts by numerous Greek scientists in collaboration with various companies and associations. It was implemented in three phases, funded by the Ministry of Development, the Ministry of Environment and Energy and the European Union.

Hydroscope, provides several national data sources from various organisations via a web interface. Each participating organisation keeps its data on its own server using the Enhydris database system for the storage and management of hydrological and meteorological data. These organisations are:

* Ministry of Environment and Energy.
* Ministry of Rural Development and Food.
* National Meteorological Service.
* National Observatory of Athens.
* Greek Prefectures.
* Public Power Corporation.

The data are structured as tables and space separated text files, but are in Greek, thus limiting their usefulness.

`hydroscoper` covers Hydroscope's data sources using the Enhydris API. The Enhydris database is implemented in PostgreSQL and details about the database can be found [here](http://bit.ly/2D0cZgA)  and about the Webservice API [here](http://bit.ly/2FlRtBB).

`hydroscoper` provides functions to:

1. Transform the available tables and data sets into tidy data frames [(tibbles)](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/).
2. Transliterate the Greek Unicode text to Latin.
3. Translate various Greek terms to English.

## Data sources

 * Ministry of Environment and Energy, National Observatory of Athens and Greek Prefectures, http://kyy.hydroscope.gr/.
 * Ministry of Rural Development and Food, http://ypaat.hydroscope.gr.
 * National Meteorological Service, http://emy.hydroscope.gr.
 * Greek Public Power Corporation, http://deh.hydroscope.gr.

Note that:

1. Only the two Ministries allow to download time series values freely.
2. `ypaat`, `emy` and `kyy` subdomains are maintened by the National Technical University Of Athens and these servers work seamlessly.
3. `deh` subdomain is maintened by the Greek Public Power Corporation, uses an older version of the Enhydris API and occasionally the server is down.

 
## Installation

Install the stable release from CRAN with:

```{r cran_installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hydroscoper")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kvantas/hydroscoper")
```


## Using hydroscoper

The functions that are provided by `hydroscoper` are:

* `get_stations, get_timeseries, get_instruments, get_water_basins, get_water_divisions, get_political_divisions, get_variables, get_units_of_measurement, get_time_steps, get_owners, get_instruments_type, get_station_type, get_database ` family functions, to retrieve tibbles with Hydroscope's data for a given data source.
* `get_data`, to retrieve a tibble with time series' values.  
* `hydro_coords`, to convert Hydroscope's points raw format to a tibble.
* `hydro_translate` to translate various terms and names from Greek to English.

The data sets that are provided by `hydroscoper` are:

* `stations` a tibble with stations' data from Hydroscope.
* `timeseries` a tibble with  time series' data from Hydroscope.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to get the stations' and time series data from the Hydroscope's Ministry of Environment and Energy database, http://kyy.hydroscope.gr/.

We will use the package's data `stations` and `timeseries`, to reduce the time needed with data munging. We can subset the station's data for the `kyy` sub-domain with:

```{r}
# load libraries
library(hydroscoper)
library(tibble)

# load data
data("stations")

# subset stations data
kyy_stations <- subset(stations, subdomain == "kyy")

# view kyy stations
kyy_stations
```

To get the time series' data for the station `200200` (http://kyy.hydroscope.gr/stations/d/200200/) we can use:

```{r}
station_ts <- subset(timeseries, station_id == 200200)
station_ts
```

We can download the station's  time series **56** (http://kyy.hydroscope.gr/time series/d/56/) to a tibble with:

``` {r get_ts}
ts_raw <- get_data(subdomain = "kyy",time_id = 56)
ts_raw
```

Let's create a plot:

``` {r plot_time_series}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = ts_raw, aes(x = Date, y = Value))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title= "30 min precipitation for station 200200",
       x="Date", y = "Rain height (mm)")+
  theme_classic()
```
