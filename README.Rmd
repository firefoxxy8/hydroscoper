`hydroscoper` is an R interface to the  Greek National Databank for Hydrological and Meteorological Information, [Hydroscope](http://www.hydroscope.gr/). Hydroscope is the result of long-standing efforts by numerous scientists from the Department of Water Resources and Environment of the National Technical University of Athens in collaboration with various companies and associations. It was implemented in three phases, funded by the Ministry of Development, Ministry of Environment and European Union.

Hydroscope, provides several national data sources from various organisations via a web interface. Each participating organisation keeps its data on its own server. These organisations are:

* Ministry of Environment and Energy.
* Ministry of Rural Development and Food.
* National Meteorological Service.
* National Observatory of Athens.
* Greek Prefectures.
* Public Power Corporation.

The Hydroscope's data sets are in Greek, thus limiting their usefulness, and raw time series values  are well structured as space seperated text files. 

`hydroscoper` covers most of Hydroscope's sources and provides functions to:

1. Transform the available tables and data sets into tidy dataframes.
2. Transliterate the Greek Unicode names to Latin.
3. Translate various Greek terms to English.

## Data sources in hydroscoper are:

 * Ministry of Environment and Energy, National Observatory of Athens and Greek Prefectures, http://kyy.hydroscope.gr/ 
 * Ministry of Rural Development and Food, http://ypaat.hydroscope.gr/
 * National Meteorological Service, http://emy.hydroscope.gr/

The front end for the data sources of Greek Public Power Corporation, http://deh.hydroscope.gr/, uses an old format and it is not currently supported. Note that only the two Ministries allow to download time series values freely.
 
## Installation

Install the stable release from CRAN with:

```{r cran_installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hydroscoper")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kvantas/hydroscoper")
```


## Using hydroscoper

The available functions that are provided by `hydroscoper` are:

* `get_stations` to retrieve a tidy dataframe with stations' data for a given data source.
* `get_coords` to retrieve the coordinates and elevation for a given station.
* `get_timeseries` to retriece a tidy dataframe with a station's time series. 
* `get_data` to retriece a tidy dataframe with a time series' values.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get a dataframe with stations from the Ministry of Environment and Energy:

```{r get_stations}
library(hydroscoper)
stations <- get_stations(subdomain = "kyy")
head(stations[c("StationID", "WaterDivisionID", "Name", "Owner", "Type")])
```

Using the above data you can get the coordinates and the elevation for a specific station, **200251**:

```{r get_coords}
crds <-  get_coords(subdomain = "kyy", stationID = 200251)
crds
```

To get the time series from the same station run:

```{r get_time_series}

ts_data <- get_timeseries(subdomain = "kyy", stationID = 200251)
ts_data[c("TimeSeriesID", "Variable", "TimeStep", "Unit", "StartDate","EndDate")]
```

You can get the time series **912** to a tidy dataframe with:
```{r get_data}
df <- get_data(subdomain = "kyy", timeID = 912)
```

Let's create a plot for these data:
```{r plot_timeseries}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = Date, y = Value))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title="Dailly rainfall data for station 200251",
       x="Date", y = "Rain (mm)")+
  theme_classic()

```
