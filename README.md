`hydroscoper` is an R interface to the Greek National Data Bank for
Hydrological and Meteorological Information,
[Hydroscope](http://www.hydroscope.gr/). Hydroscope is the result of
long-standing efforts by numerous Greek scientists in collaboration with
various companies and associations. It was implemented in three phases,
funded by the Ministry of Development, the Ministry of Environment and
Energy and the European Union.

Hydroscope, provides several national data sources from various
organisations via a web interface. Each participating organisation keeps
its data on its own server using the Enhydris database system for the
storage and management of hydrological and meteorological data. These
organisations are:

  - Ministry of Environment and Energy.
  - Ministry of Rural Development and Food.
  - National Meteorological Service.
  - National Observatory of Athens.
  - Greek Prefectures.
  - Public Power Corporation.

The data are structured as tables and space separated text files, but
are in Greek, thus limiting their usefulness.

`hydroscoper` covers Hydroscope’s data sources using the [Enhydris
API](http://enhydris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and provides
functions to:

1.  Transform the available tables and data sets into tidy data frames.
2.  Transliterate the Greek Unicode names to Latin.
3.  Translate various Greek terms to English.

## Data sources

  - Ministry of Environment and Energy, National Observatory of Athens
    and Greek Prefectures, <http://kyy.hydroscope.gr/>
  - Ministry of Rural Development and Food, <http://ypaat.hydroscope.gr>
  - National Meteorological Service, <http://emy.hydroscope.gr>
  - Greek Public Power Corporation, <http://deh.hydroscope.gr>

Note that only the two Ministries allow to download time series values
freely.

## Installation

Install the stable release from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("hydroscoper")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kvantas/hydroscoper")
```

## Using hydroscoper

The functions that are provided by `hydroscoper` are:

  - `get_...` family functions to retrieve a tidy data frame with
    Hydroscope’s data for a given data source.
  - `get_data` to retrieve a tidy data frame with a time series’ values.
